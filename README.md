# Weather App

We're getting deep into the javascript portion of The Odin Project. At this point I'm feeling more confident with my web development skills and programming skills in general. I feel like in this project I wrote much cleaner and safer code than the todo app, so that makes me happy.

With this project I learnt about asynchronous javascript. I used await keyword heavily, and unfortunately didn't get a chance to use any advanced Promise functions so maybe I didn't get a chance to learn them properly. Also, this was my first introductions to APIs and I think that went over great.

Had fun with this challenge and went much smoother than last project. Here's to finishing the whole curriculum!
